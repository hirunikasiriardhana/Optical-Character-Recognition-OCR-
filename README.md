# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts images of text into editable and searchable digital text by analyzing character shapes and matching them with corresponding digital representations.
In this project, I utilized the OpenCV and pytesseract libraries to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for recognizing Sinhala typed words. The process involved pre-processing the input images using OpenCV to enhance the quality and accuracy of text recognition. After pre-processing, the pytesseract library was employed to extract the Sinhala text from the images. Once the Sinhala text was identified, the system translated it into English, allowing for the conversion of text from one language to another. This project effectively demonstrated the ability to automate the recognition and translation of Sinhala text using OCR technology.
